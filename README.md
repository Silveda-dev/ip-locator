# ip-locator

IP Locator is a C-based lightweight tool operating out of the terminal that provides key information on IPv4 addresses (location, ISP, organisation). It uses the [IP-API](https://ip-api.com/) geolocation API and the [cJSON](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON) library (included within the repository). Note that information can only be sourced on organisation, not private, IP addresses.
