# ip-locator

IP Locator is a C-based lightweight tool operating out of the terminal that provides key information on IPv4 addresses (location, ISP, organisation). It uses the [IP-API](https://ip-api.com/) geolocation API and the [cJSON](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON) library (included within the repository).

## Instructions
1) Download and navigate to the repository, then `make run`.
2) You may need to [install](https://ec.haxx.se/install/index.html) libcurl if you do not already have it installed.
